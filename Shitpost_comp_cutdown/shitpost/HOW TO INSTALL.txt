TO INSTALL:

Move the folder containing this txt and a bunch of other folders to `Portal 2/`
The resulting path should be `Portal 2/shitpost/HOW TO INSTALL.txt`

Add `shitpost` as a game to Portal `2/portal2/gameinfo.txt`.

It should contain something sort of like this, but you may have more folders

```

SearchPaths
		{
			Game				|gameinfo_path|.
			Game				"shitpost"
		}

```

Launch Portal 2
and then enter `map hq_shitpost` into the console
